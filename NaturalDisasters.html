<p>Natural and human-caused disasters affect thousands of people each year. 
Major adverse events such as these have the potential to cause catastrophic loss of life and physical destruction.They are often unexpected and can leave whole communities in shock
People who live through a disaster can experience emotional distress.Feelings of anxiety, constant worrying, trouble sleeping, and other
depression-like symptoms are common responses to disasters before,during, and after the event. Many people are able to “bounce back” from disasters 
with help from family and the community, but others may need additional support to cope and move forward on the path of recovery.
Anyone can be at risk, including survivors living in the impacted areas and first responders and recovery workers.
<h1>Natural Disasters</h1>
Natural disasters are large-scale geological or meteorological events that have the potential to cause loss of life or property. These types of disasters include:

Severe storms and floods are the most common types of natural disasters reported in the United States. These meteorological events are occasionally preceded by presidential “emergency declarations” requiring state and local planning prior to the event, such as evacuations and protection of public assets. Disaster Distress Helpline staff are available to speak to those who call or text before, during, and after a natural disaster.
<h1>Human-Caused Disasters</h1>
Examples include industrial accidents, shootings, acts of terrorism, and incidents of mass violence. As with natural disasters, these types of traumatic events may also cause loss of life and property. They may also prompt evacuations from certain areas and overwhelm behavioral health resources in the affected communities.
In the aftermath of the tragic loss of life that occurred on September 11, 2001, the feelings of loss of security and well-being—arguably the most crucial ingredients for leading a happy, healthy life—dramatically affected the citizens of the United States. Disaster Distress Helpline staff are also trained to respond to calls or texts related to these types of disasters.

<h1>Classification of Natural Disasters</h1>
<a name="TornadoesandSevereStorms">
     
<h1>Tornadoes and Severe Storms</h1>
Tornadoes are outgrowths of powerful thunderstorms that appear as rotating, funnel-shaped clouds. They extend from a thunderstorm to the ground with violent winds that average 30 miles per hour. Also, they can vary in speed dramatically from being stationary to 70 miles per hour. With a loud roar that sounds similar to a freight train, tornadoes in the United States typically are 500 feet across and travel on the ground for five miles. Every state is at some risk from tornadoes and the severe storms that produce them. These same destructive storms also cause strong gusts of wind, lightning strikes, and flash floods.
<BR>
Tornadoes can strike quickly with little or no warning, giving those in impacted areas barely enough time to take shelter. Because of the unpredictable nature of tornadoes and severe storms, it’s normal for people to experience emotional distress. Feelings such as overwhelming anxiety, trouble sleeping, and other depression-like symptoms are common responses to these types of disasters. Other signs of emotional distress related to tornadoes and severe storms include:
<BR>
<ul>
    <li>Worrying a lot or feeling guilty but not sure why</li>
    <li>Feeling helpless or hopeless</li>
    <li>Thinking that something is going to happen when forecasts for any storm are issued</li>
    <li>Constant yelling or fighting with family and friends</li>
    <li>Having nightmares or thoughts and memories related to the storm</li>
</ul><BR>
Symptoms of distress may appear before, during, and after a tornado or severe storm and may manifest in the hours, days, weeks, months, or even years after the storms occur.

<br><a name="HurricanesandTropicalStorms">
<h1>Hurricanes and Tropical Storms</h1>
Hurricanes are types of tropical storms that form in the southern Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and eastern Pacific Ocean. Hurricanes affect millions of people who live along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts each year. Parts of the Southwest United States and the Pacific Coast can also experience severe weather associated with hurricanes, which include tornadoes, floods, and heavy winds.
<BR>
Hurricane Michael in 2018 created life-threatening conditions for residents, including prolonged power outages, storm surges, and municipal service disruptions.
<BR>
It’s normal for hurricanes to cause people to experience emotional distress. Feelings such as overwhelming anxiety, constant worrying, trouble sleeping, and other depression-like symptoms are common responses before, during, and after these types of storms. Other signs of emotional distress related to hurricanes include:
<BR>
<ul>
    <li>Fearing that forecasted storms may develop into a hurricane even when the chances they will are low</li>
    <li>Constant yelling or fighting with family and friends</li>
    <li>Having thoughts, memories, or nightmares related to the storm that you can’t seem to get out of your head</li>
</ul><BR>
These are just a few warning signs of disaster-related distress.

<a name="Floods">
<h1>Floods</h1>
Floods are one of the most common hazards in the United States. They occur when land that is normally dry experiences an overflow of water. Several events cause floods, including hurricanes and tropical storms, failed dams or levees, and flash floods that occur within a few minutes or hours of excessive rainfall.
<BR>
Although coastal areas are more vulnerable to floods, particularly during hurricane season, they can occur anywhere and can vary in size and duration. Even very small streams, gullies, and creeks that may appear harmless in dry weather can flood.
<BR>
The physical destruction of a flood can vary, with some carrying away everything in its path, including houses, bridges, cars, and even people who may be trapped or wading in water. Further, the economic loss from hazardous flood conditions can be significant, costing in the billions, as with Hurricane Michael in 2018 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
<BR>
It’s normal for people to experience emotional distress during a flood. Simply anticipating the possibility of what could be lost or destroyed during a flood can cause people to experience overwhelming anxiety or lose sleep. Other signs of emotional distress related to floods include:
<BR>
<ul>
    <li>Feeling helpless or hopeless</li>
    <li>Fearing that forecasted storms may develop into a hurricane, even when the chances they will are low</li>
    <li>Constant yelling or fighting with family and friends</li>
    <li>Excessive absences from work or school</li>
    <li>Having thoughts and memories related to the flood that you can’t get out of your head</li>
</ul><BR></a>

<a name="Wildfires">
<h1>Wildfires</h1>
Wildfires are usually triggered by lightning or accidents and often go unnoticed at first. They can spread quickly and are especially destructive if they occur near forests, rural areas, remote mountain sites, and other woodland settings where people live. While not reported as often as floods or tornadoes and severe storms, they, too, can cause emotional distress in people living in affected areas.
<BR>
In 2013, more than 47,500 wildfires were reported in the United States. They destroyed thousands of structures, including about 1,100 homes, and burned more than 4 million acres of land.
<BR>
Feelings such as overwhelming anxiety, constant worrying, trouble sleeping, and other depression-like symptoms are common responses before, during, and after wildfires. Other signs of emotional distress related to wildfires include:
<BR>
<ul>
    <li>Having thoughts, memories, or nightmares related to the wildfire that you can’t seem to get out of your head</li>
    <li>Worrying a lot of the time; feeling guilty but not sure why</li>
    <li>Excessive absences from work or school</li>
</ul><BR></a>

<a name="Earthquakes">
<h1>Earthquakes</h1>
An earthquake is the shifting of the Earth’s plates, which results in a sudden shaking of the ground that can last for a few seconds to a few minutes. Within seconds, mild initial shaking can strengthen and become violent. Earthquakes happen without warning and can happen at any time of year. Certain states are more prone to higher frequency of earthquakes, particularly California, Hawaii, Nevada, and Washington.
<BR>
Earthquakes are quite common and occur somewhere around the world every day. However, the vast majority are considered minor. The U.S. Geological Survey in 2015 reported more than 3,000 earthquakes in the United States.
<BR>
Even minor earthquakes that cause little damage and destruction can cause people to experience emotional distress (especially in areas not accustomed to these events). Aftershocks can continue to occur for months afterwards and can be just as stressful.
<BR>
It’s normal for people to experience emotional distress during an earthquake. Simply anticipating the possibility of what could be lost or destroyed during the event can cause people to experience overwhelming anxiety or lose sleep. Other signs of emotional distress related to earthquakes include:
<BR>
<ul>
    <li>Having thoughts, memories, or nightmares related to the wildfire that you can’t seem to get out of your head</li>
    <li>Having difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much</li>
    <li> Being easily startled</li>
</ul><BR></a>

<a name="Drought">
<h1>Droughts</h1>
A drought is a normal, reoccurring weather event that can vary in intensity and duration by region of the country and even by location within a state. Drought occurs when there is lower than average precipitation over a significant period of time, usually a season or more. Other causes of drought can be a delay in the rainy season or the timing of rain in relation to crop growth.
<BR>
Drought is a slow-moving hazardous event, so the psychological effects of living through this type of disaster are more subtle and last longer than with other natural disasters. Low water availability creates shortages in water supplies that impact various activities and the environment. The impact is even greater as humans place demands on water supplies. Additionally, drought conditions increase the risk of other natural disasters, such as wildfires, and landslides.
<BR>
Warning signs for emotional distress related to drought may include:
<BR>
<ul>
    <li>Feelings of overwhelming anxiety</li>
    <li>Constant worrying</li>
    <li>  Trouble sleeping and other depression-like symptoms</li>
    <li> Disputes between people over limited water supplies</li>
    <li> Health concerns related to dust, low water flow, or poor water and air quality</li>
    <li>Financial concerns related to crop failures, low supply and demand of agricultural-related products, or rising food prices</li>
</ul><BR>
These are common responses to disasters such as droughts, although reactions can vary.</a><BR></p>
