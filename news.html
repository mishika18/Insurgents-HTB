<h1>1.Bushfires, Australia – 2019-2020</h1>
Signs of bushfires in Australia officially started to show in October of 2019 due to prolonged droughts around the country. Over the next few months, the bushfires spread fast and wide, showing no signs of stopping. With time a state of emergency was declared in Queensland and New South Wales in November, and slowly all the other states followed as the fires continued to spread. Also known as Black Summer, the Australian bushfires were deemed as one of the biggest natural disasters.  The extent of damage ranged from an estimated 18 million hectares burned over 9000 buildings and homes destroyed, and 400 deaths (directly or indirectly).

<h1>3. Covid-19, China and all over the world – 2019-2020</h1>
<br>
In December 2019, the first Coronavirus case was identified in Wuhan, China. Because it was not considered deadly at the moment, no one could imagine the kind of impact this virus would have globally. China recorded the first death on 11th January 2020 and subsequently two months later, WHO declared the virus to be a world-wide pandemic on 11th March.  As 2nd April came around, the world number of cases surpassed a million.

<h1>4. Volcano Eruption, Philippines - 2020</h1>
<br>
With more than 20 active volcanoes in the Philippines, the country is constantly at the danger of being affected by a catastrophe. Incidentally the second most active volcano, Taal Volcano erupted in January 2020. On 12th January, the volcano started rumbling, sending tremors out and further resulting in an eruption. As a result, a large amount of ash dust was emitted and forced authorities to evacuate over 8,000 people close by and 3,00,000 people overall. Taal Volcano’s last eruption was 43 years ago. Reports from the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology put forward the following data; a total of over 2,000 volcano induced tectonic earthquakes took place, out of which 176 were felt. As an impact of this, the Philippines is still picking up the pieces and healing from the damage.

<h1>6. Swarms of Locusts, Asia-East Africa-India-Middle East - 2020</h1>
<br>
Desert Locusts are migratory pests that can eat as much food is around the amount 35,000 people can eat. They feed on crops and have the power to destroy crops within seconds. Moreover, they breed rapidly and almost 150 million of these pests can exist in a 1 square kilometer area. They do not harm human beings.
<br>
Being called one of the worst pest attacks in almost 26 years, it is being said that the sudden increase of these locusts has occurred due to a change in the climate. The increase in temperature has made it possible for breeding to happen while also making it habitable.
<br>
In India, videos of the locusts swarming have been circulated and they can make a person uncomfortable. The states of Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh have seen the effects of these pest attacks.

<h1>10. Green Snow, Antarctica - 2020</h1>
<br>
When thinking about Antarctica, one can imagine everything white; from glaciers to snow, penguins, seals, and more. However, it has been noticed that parts of Antarctica are turning green due to climate change and the bloom of snow algae. Snow algae tend to thrive on temperatures that are above the freezing temperature and as the climate is causing the snow to melt, it has accelerated the speed at which the snow algae grows. If someone were to look at the continent from space, they would see some of the green parts.
