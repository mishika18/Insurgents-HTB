  Natural disasters are catastrophic events that often occur without warning and disrupt the ecosystem, causing damage to personal lives, property, transportation, and livelihood. While it is never possible to prevent a disaster, the damage can be minimized through timely preparation. As such, every natural disaster has its own set of precautions to be taken, which must be followed to save precious lives.

  <h1>Disaster Preparedness Tips</h1>             
  <ul>
    <li>Communicate where you will be. Contact someone outside the affected area to tell them where you will be for the duration of the event. Business owners should remind employees of their roles in helping to get the business back up and running, and how they will be notified when the facility is open again.</li>
    <li>Know the warning signs and alert signals for your area. Stay tuned to your local television or radio station or community alert system for emergency information.</li>
    <li>Check your emergency survival kit. Make sure your emergency survival kit is stocked with essential items and kept in an easily accessible location.</li>
    <li>Collect emergency building materials. Depending on the type of disaster, you may want to have emergency materials on hand, such as plywood, sandbags and waterproof tarps.</li>
    <li>Fuel up your vehicles and equipment. If you have an emergency generator, make sure you have fresh fuel on hand. Depending on your situation, you may need a supply of extra fuel. If so, be sure to store the spare fuel in an approved container in a safe location. Never use a generator inside or even in a garage. Make sure it is located a safe distance from windows, doors and vents.</li>
    <li>Be sure you have car chargers for your cell phone, smart phone and other portable devices. Having car chargers available can assist you in staying in communication with others if your electricity goes out. Do not forget to fully charge devices before a storm.</li>
    <li>Secure all outdoor objects or move them inside. Grills, patio furniture and flowerpots are common household items that can become airborne in high winds. Do not use grills inside or store propane tanks inside the house or garage. Business owners should also remember to secure outdoor signage, benches and equipment to help minimize potential damage.</li>
    <li>Know how to shut off all utilities. It is always a good idea to know how to turn off the gas, electricity and water in your home or place of business. If you need to evacuate suddenly, it may be prudent to turn off utilities before leaving. Before doing so, consider equipment that can help minimize damage and should therefore not have utilities interrupted, such as electricity to sump pumps or fire protection equipment.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h1>How To Stay Safe During A Natural Disaster</h1><br>
  To keep you and your family safe during a natural disaster, these preparedness safety tips can prevent injuries and make the difference in an emergency:
    <ul>
      <li>Stay informed. Tune in to local authorities for information about evacuations and safety tips.</li>
      <li>Have a plan for evacuation. Know where you will go during a natural disaster and how you will get there.</li>
      <li>Keep emergency kits on hand. Stock kits with flashlights, batteries, first aid supplies, and important identification information.</li>
      <li>Avoid unnecessary risks. Do not leave your home unless instructed to do so.</li>
      <li>Go to the safest area in your home. During a flood, go to a higher floor. If a tornado is in the area, go to a basement or inner room on the bottom floor of your home.</li>
    </ul><br>          
  Here are a few precautions one must take to save their lives and that of others during natural disasters.
  <h1>Earthquakes</h1>
  <br>
  The shifting of tectonic plates causes earthquakes under the earth’s crust, and it is responsible for mass destruction. When faced with an earthquake, these tips can be of use:
  <br>
  If you are indoors,<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Take cover under a sturdy table or other pieces of furniture, and hold on until the shaking stops.</li>
    <li>Stay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, such as lighting fixtures or furniture.</li>
    <li>Stay inside until the shaking stops, and it is safe to go outside. Most injuries occur to people trying to move a different location inside the building or try to leave.</li>
    <li>Do not use the elevators.</li>
  </ul>
  If you are outdoors,
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Stay away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires.</li>
    <li>Stand in open ground until the shaking stops. It’s dangerous to stay directly outside buildings, at exits, and alongside exterior walls. Ground movement during an earthquake is seldom the direct cause of death or injury. Most earthquake-related casualties result from collapsing walls, flying glass, and falling objects.</li>
  </ul><br>

  <h1>Tsunamis</h1><br>
  Tsunamis are a series of enormous ocean waves caused by earthquakes, underwater landslides, or volcanic eruptions. Tsunami waves range from tens to hundreds of feet tall and can travel twenty to thirty miles per hour. When faced with this phenomenon, these tips are to be followed:
  <br><ul>
    <li>Turn on your radio/TV to learn and follow the precautionary instructions during a tsunami warning, primarily when you reside near a coastal area.</li>
    <li>Move inland to higher ground immediately and stay there.</li>
    <li>Check for a noticeable recession in water away from the shoreline as this is nature’s tsunami warning and should be heeded. It would help if you moved away immediately.</li>
    <li>Please stay away from flooded and damaged areas until officials say it is safe to return.</li>
    <li>Please keep yourself away from debris in the water; it may pose a safety hazard to boats and people.</li>
  </ul><br>

  <h1>Cyclones</h1>
  <br>
  Cyclones are tropical storms, caused by atmospheric disturbances around a low-pressure area. Cyclones are accompanied by strong winds, moving at a speed of sixty-two kmph or more. When faced with a hurricane, keep these tips in mind:
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Be alert to changing weather conditions.</li>
    <li>Listen to radio/TV for the latest information.</li>
    <li>Look for approaching storms.</li>
    <li>Look for the following warning signs: – Dark, often greenish sky – Large hailstones, a large, dark, low-lying cloud (particularly if rotating), roars, similar to a freight train.</li>
    <li>If you see approaching storms or any of the danger signs, be prepared to take shelter immediately.</li>
    <li>If you are under a tornado warning, seek shelter immediately. NOTE: In places where you have designated cyclone shelters, take refuge there.</li>
  </ul><br>

  <h1>Floods</h1>
  <br>
  Floods are among the earth’s most common and dangerous natural hazards, formed due to a flow of water on areas of land that are usually dry. Excessive rain, damage to nearby dams, and tsunamis are some of its causes. When faced with flooding, these tips are to be followed:
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not attempt to walk, swim, or drive through the floods. Floodwater contains debris and contamination and can also be deadly due to fallen electrical lines in the water.</li>
    <li>Stay clear of bridges over fast-moving water.</li>
    <li>Keep an eye out for evacuation alerts.</li>
    <li>Move to higher ground.</li>
    <li>If your vehicle is trapped in flood and water starts filling inside the car, seek refuge on the roof.</li>
  </ul><br>

  <h1>Hail Storms</h1><br>
  When you think of natural disasters, hail storms are not likely to jump to the front of your mind. But, these pesky storms can cause an overwhelming amount of damage to your property. In 2015, there were 5,412 major hail storms, accounting for approximately 40 percent of all insured losses.
  <br>
  Hailstorms can cause a significant amount of damage. But, you can prepare yourself for safety at home. First and foremost, resist the urge to bring in your possessions after hail begins to fall to avoid injuries. Your safety is of the utmost importance. You can avoid personal injury by staying indoors.
  <br>
  To avoid having to brave the storm, take these preventative measures:
  <ul>
    <li>Park cars in garage or covered areas: Vehicles stand a better chance if they are protected in an enclosed area.</li>
    <li>Don’t leave furniture and other valuables outside: Store outdoor furniture in a shed or bring inside. Try to avoid leaving any other valuables outdoors, such as grills, outdoor toys, or recreational equipment like bicycles or skateboards.</li>
    <li>Keep clear of windows and draw curtains to protect from shattered glass: Drawing curtains will help protect from injuries caused by shattering glass.</li>
  </ul>
  Assess damage immediately after storm has passed and file claim as soon as possible to avoid further damage:
  <ul>
    <li>Check roof for damage.</li>
    <li>Look for torn shingles or leaks.</li>
    <li>Evaluate metal gutters. Make sure there are no obstructing dents or holes.</li>
    <li>Determine whether damage has occurred to windows or glass doors. Repair immediately.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Tornado Or High Winds</h1>
  <br>
  The United States experiences about 1,200 tornadoes each year. On average, tornadoes claim 227 lives and lead to annual damage costs of approximately $1,086,575,000.
  Tornadoes can be a scary emergency. In 2012, a category six tornado swept through parts of Indiana and Kentucky causing $1.5 billion in damage. Winds were so severe that debris was later found nearly 57 miles away.
  While tornadoes often occur with little notice, there are some preventative measures you can take to prepare your home. Check out these tips:
  <ul>
    <li>Secure large appliances with cabling or metal strapping.</li>
    <li>Reinforce your garage door by adding weight or replace if not in good repair.</li>
    <li>Secure siding. This can be done with fasteners or other materials.</li>

  <h1>Wildfires</h1>
  <br>
  2015 set a new record in the United States for wildfires. From January to December, there were 68,151 wildfires causing damage to 10,125,149 acres. According to CNN, these fires destroyed 4,636 structures and 2,638 residences. In 2017 alone, from January 1 to March 17, 10,829 wildfires have burned 2.1 million acres. Wildfires are a serious threat and can cause an astonishing amount of damage very quickly.
  Often, wildfires are caused by people. Many wildfires start because of a campfire, exhaust sparks, or even arson. Some are the result of lightning. Regardless of the catalyst, there is potential for devastation. How can you practice good safety at home to reduce the probability that your home and family will be affected?
  Check out these tips:
  <ul>
    <li>Install fire detectors.</li>
    <li>Use fire-resistant building materials when possible.</li>
    <li>Practice fire prevention around your home.</li>
    <li>Don’t keep fuel sources on your property.</li>
    <li>Keep trees trimmed and remove dead foliage.</li>
    <li>Avoid using tools that create sparks in dry or windy areas.</li>
    <li>Do not use grills within 15 feet of your home.</li>
    <li>Install fire sprinklers.</li>
    <li>Cover all crawl spaces and access holes with 1/4 inch or less wire mesh. This prevents any blowing embers from entering your home.</li>
    <li>Keep a fire extinguisher in an easily accessible place.</li>
    <li>Check your fire detectors frequently to ensure they are functioning properly at all times. Keep gloves and thick-soled shoes on hand to avoid injury should a fire occur. </li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Evacuation Tips </h1><br>
  Ultimately, your safety is paramount. When a situation is beyond your control, you may need to evacuate. In any natural disaster situation, FEMA recommends practicing the “Five Ps of Evacuation”:
  <ul>
    <li>People: First, move people and pets or other animals to safety.</li>
    <li>Prescriptions: Make sure you take any necessary prescriptions, including hearing aids, eyeglasses, or asthma medication.</li>
    <li>Papers: Grab any important documents, including identification information.</li>
    <li>Personal Needs: Take items you might need for person needs such as food, water, clothing, or emergency supplies.</li>
    <li>Priceless Items: Bring valuables, photos, mementos, heirlooms, or anything that is irreplaceable.</li>
  </ul>
  Mother Nature is an unpredictable force. While you can’t always avoid the potential for danger due to natural disasters, you can take preventative measures to avoid injuries, achieve safety at home, and reduce the amount of damage to your property and your family.
