<h1>Disaster Management in India: Classification, Policies and other Details!</h1>
Losses due to disasters have shown growing trend in terms of lives and property throughout the world due to urbanization, increasing population and increasing degradation of environment. The global efforts to manage disasters are not matched with the frequency and magnitude of disasters.
<br>However, for the last 15 years or so some new thinking on disaster management has emerged at global level which pleads for a proactive and preventive approach and integrates disaster management with ongoing development activities that is sustainable development.
<br>
According to World Disaster Report 2009, hydro meteorological event, linked to climate change – floods, storms, heat waves and drought together accounted for nearly 60 percent of Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF). In Myanmar alone, cyclone Nargis claimed some 1, 38,000 lives last years.
<br>
Earthquake in China’s Sichuan Province killed some 88,000 people, affected 46 million people; a major US flood 11 million and a drought in Thailand 10 million. But there were fewer disasters worldwide in 2008 than in any other year of the preceding decade; 326 natural and 259 technological disasters.

<h1>India’s Disaster Profile</h1>
The Indian subcontinent is among the world’s most disaster prone areas. Almost 85% of India’s area is vulnerable to one or multiple hazard. Of the 28 states and 7 union territories, 22 are disaster-prone.
<br>
It is vulnerable to wind storms spawned in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, earthquakes caused by active crustal movement in the Himalayan mountains, floods brought by monsoons, and droughts in the country’s arid and semi-arid areas.
<br>
Almost 57% of the land is vulnerable to earthquake (high seismic zones lll-V), 68% to drought, 8% to cyclones and 12% to floods. India has also become much more vulnerable to tsunamis since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.

<a name="NationalLevelOrganisation"></a><h1>National Level Organisation</h1>
‘Disaster Management’has been seen as the direct responsibility of State Governments. However, the following decisionmaking and standing bodies have been responsible for disaster management at the Central level:
<ul>
  <li>Cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister.</li>
  <li>Empowered Group of Ministers</li>
  <li>There has been a National Crisis Management Committee headed by the Cabinet Secretary.</li>
  <li>Crisis Management Group under the chairmanship of the Central Relief Commissioner</li>
</ul>
Comprising senior officers from various Ministries and concerned Departments, which has been responsible for reviewing contingency plans and measures required for dealing with a natural disaster, and coordinates the activities of the Central Ministries and the State Governments in relation to disaster preparedness and relief.
<ul>
  <li>For all natural disasters except droughts, the Ministry of Home Affairs is the nodal Ministry and the other Ministries play a supportive role. For droughts the nodal ministry is the Ministry of Agriculture, wherein the responsibility lies with its Department of Agriculture and Cooperation.</li>
  <li>Technical Organisations, such as, the Indian Meteorological Department (Cyclone / Earthquake), Central Water Commission (Floods), Building and Material Promotion Council (Construction Laws), Bureau of Indian Standards (Norms), Defence Research & Development Organisation (Nuclear/ Biological Disasters), and Directorate General Civil Defence provide specific technical support to coordination of disaster response activities.</li>
  <li>The Ministry of Home Affairs has set up National Disaster Management Division (NDMD) as the apex body within the Government for this purpose.<br>
Among other organizational initiatives, in the past, it had been proposed to:
<ul>
  <li>Establish a specialised response team for dealing with nuclear/ biological/ chemical disasters</li>
  <li>Establish search and rescue teams in each State, and</li>
  <li>Strengthen communication systems in the North Eastern Region.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1>Help during Natural Disasters</h1>
The dimensions of the response to natural disasters at the Central level have been determined (since 1990-91) in accordance with the existing policy of financing relief expenditure of States through a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, the Calamity Relief Fund [CRF] scheme (which operates in combination with the National Calamity Contingency Fund [NCCF] scheme), and keeping in view the factors like:
<ul>
  <li>Gravity of a natural disaster;</li>
  <li>Scale of the relief operation necessary; and</li>
  <li>Requirements of Central assistance for augmenting financial resources and logistic support at the disposal of the State Government.</li>
</ul>
The country has had a Contingency Action Plan, which identifies initiatives that should be taken by various Central Ministries and Public Departments in the wake of disasters. It sets out the procedures and determines the focal points in the administrative machinery to facilitate launching of rescue and relief operations in response to a disaster.
<a name="StateLevelOrganisation"></a><h1>State Level Organisation</h1>
<ul>
  <li>In a State, disaster response has usually been the responsibility of the Relief and Rehabilitation Department or the Department of Revenue (of the State Government). The Chief Secretary of the State heads the State level committee related to disaster management.</li>
  <li> This committee is in overall charge of the relief operations in the State and the Relief Commissioners who are in charge of the relief and rehabilitation measures function under the overall direction and control of the State level committee.</li>
  <li>In many States, the Secretary, Department of Revenue, is also in-charge of relief operations. State Governments usually have relief manuals and the districts have their contingency plans, which are supposed to be updated from time to time.</li>
</ul>
<a name="DistrictLevelOrganisation"></a><h1>District Level Organisation</h1>
<ul>
  <li>There has been District Level Coordination and Review Committee headed by the Collector as Chairman, with participation of all other related agencies and departments.</li>
  <li>The district administration is the focal point of all Governmental plans and activities. The actual day-to-day function of administering relief has been the responsibility of the Collector/District Magistrate/Deputy Commissioner who exercises coordinating and supervising powers over all departments at the district level.</li>
</ul>
Thus, India has had a contingency action plan for natural disasters at the national level. Disaster relief manuals and disaster plans have been available at the State level and also at the district
level, but these plans are not always updated and they have mainly focused on relief.

<a name="MarginMoneyScheme"></a><h1>Margin Money Scheme</h1><br>
The Second Finance Commission (SFC), while estimating the States’ committed expenditure (for the five years of its recommendation period of 1955-56 to 1959-60), included in their annual revenue a margin for enabling the States to set apart sizeable sums of money for accumulation in a fund for meeting expenditure necessitated by natural calamities. The annual amount as recommended by the SFC, based roughly on the average expenditure over the previous decade, was Rs. 6.15 crore for all the 14 States at that time. This scheme was later called as the ‘Margin Money Scheme’. State Governments had to set up separate funds and transfer the amounts calculated for each of them to such funds annually.
<a name="CalamityReliefFund(CRF)Scheme"></a><h1>Calamity Relief Fund (CRF) Scheme</h1><br>
CRF is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for financing of immediate relief expenditure incurred by the States in the wake of a natural calamity. A CRF is constituted for each State, and receives contributions from the Centre and the respective State Government in the ratio of 75:25. States’ relief expenditure in case of only ten specified natural calamities, viz. drought, flood, cyclone, earthquake, fire, hailstorm, landslides, avalanches, cloudburst, and pest attacks are eligible for getting financed by this scheme.
<a name="NCCFScheme"></a><h1> NCCF Scheme</h1><br>
National Calamity Contingency Fund (NCCF) is interlinked with CRF. Union Government set up NCCF on recommendations of the Eleventh Finance Commission in the year 2000. The NCCF is a Central Government fund maintained for providing additional financial assistance to any State Government for incurring expenditure on relief, in excess of the Centre’s contribution to the CRF of that State. Such assistance is considered by the Central Government only when the natural calamity is of rare severity. 
<a name="NationalDisasterManagementAct2005"></a><h1>National Disaster Management Act 2005</h1><br>
National Disaster Management Act, 2005 defines events that cause substantial less of life, prosperity and environment. It read, “Disaster means catastrophe, mishap, calamity or grave occurrence in any area, arising from nature or man-made causes, or by accident or negligence which result in substantial loss of life, of human suffering or damage to, and destruction of property, or damage to, or degradation of environment, and is of such nature or magnitude as to be beyond the coping capacity of the community of affected areas.”
<br>
